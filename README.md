Q1. 
Software process model is an abstract representation of a process. It shows a description of a process from some particular perspective.
It is important because it ensures that the software meets the organization requirements.  

Q2. Comparing and contrasting waterfall model and Agile model.
The two models have some similarities. This includes
I. The waterfall model and Agile model are both software  development process models.
II. The two models try to meet user requirements.
Let us talk about the difference between the two models.
A. Waterfall process model

Plan-driven model.separate and distinct phases of specification and development .
There separate identified phases in waterfall model:
I. Requirements analysis and definition 
II. System and software design
II. Implement and unit testing
IV. Integration and system testing
V. Operation and maintenance

Benefits of the waterfall model
I. The Softwares are systematically and carefully developed.
II. It places more emphasis on software maintenance.

The drawback of the waterfall model is the difficulty in accommodating change after the process is underway.
In principle, a phase has to be completed before moving onto the next phase.
Inflexibility partitioning of the projects into stages makes it difficult  to respond to changing customer requirements.

The Agile model
In agile process, planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements. 
The benefit of the agile process is that, the cost of accommodating change in user requirements is reduced.
Also, it is easier to get customer feedback on development work that has been done.

Q3. 
The Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a modern generic process model that is organized into phases ( inception, elaboration, construction and, transition) but separates activities ( requirements, analysis and design , etc.)from these phases.
It is different from other software development models because it separates activities (requirements, analysis and design) from its phases thus, inception, elaboration, construction and, transition .
The key phases in the Rational Unified Process is inception, elaboration, construction and transition.

It has some benefits. This includes:
I. Develop software iteratively: plan  increments based on customer priorities and deliver higher priority increments first.
II. Manage requirements: Explicitly document customer requirements and keep track of changes to these requirements.
The drawbacks of Rational Unified Process include:
I. Possible to create moving target problems.
II. It is expensive.
