Question 1.

	Ans: A software process model is a standardized approach to software development that guides
	 	the activities of the software development team. It defines a set of activities, milestones,
		and deliverables that need to be completed throughout the software development lifecycle.

Question 2.  
	Ans: Waterfall and Agile are two software process models that have significant differences in their approach
	 	to software development. Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach to software development, where each stage
	 	of the development process is completed before moving on to the next stage. The key phases in the Waterfall model are
		requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. In contrast, Agile is an iterative and incremental
	 	approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and customer satisfaction. Agile development is 
		organized into small, manageable iterations called sprints, with a focus on delivering working software quickly and continuously
	 	improving the product based on feedback. The key differences between the two models are their approach to requirements, the order 
		of the development process, their level of flexibility and their speed. 
			The Waterfall model provides a rigid and structured process which may result in more predictable outcomes but may be inflexible and 
		slow to react to change. Agile model provides a flexible and iterative approach that can respond quickly to change but may result
		 in less predictable outcomes due to its rapid pace and focus on changing requirements.
Question 3.
	Ans: Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a software development process model that is based on the iterative and incremental approach of Agile,
		 but with a greater emphasis on documentation, architecture, and formal project management. RUP divides the software development process into
	 	four phases: Inception, Elaboration, Construction, and Transition. In the Inception phase, the project scope and requirements are defined.
		 In the Elaboration phase, the software architecture is designed, and the system requirements are analyzed. In the Construction phase, 
		the software is developed, tested, and integrated. In the Transition phase, the software is deployed, and the system is tested and evaluated.
		 The key benefits of RUP include its emphasis on documentation, formal project management, and quality assurance. 
		However, some of the drawbacks include its complexity, high overhead, and potential for delayed project delivery due to its comprehensive process.
