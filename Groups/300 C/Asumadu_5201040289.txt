1. A software process model represents the order in which the activities of
 software development will be undertaken. It describes the sequence in which the phases of the 
 software lifecycle  will be performed.
1b. Beacuse is simple, easy to understand and follow ,also highly structured and is good for beginners in development.
 

 2a. The difference between Agile and  Waterfall is that Waterfall breaks down software development into isolated stages/phases that flow into each other,
  while Agile uses iterative development cycles in which multiple lifecycle phases can run in parallel.
 2b.  The key difference between the two is that waterfall breaks down the development software into isolated phaases but the Agile advocate
  iterative development cycles.
2c. Agile is easy to adaptation, encourages experimentation and accept changes of direction in every phases,
even in later phases of the project over waterfall.and also costing is very less and delivered quickly than waterfall.
But Waterfall model is suited for smaller projects where requirements are well defined whiles agile is suitable for complex project.

3a. Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a software development process for object-oriented models which uses an
 iterative software development process framework.
3b. It differ because RUP reduces unexpected development costs and prevents wastage of resources
3c. Inception
    Elaboration
    Construction
    Transition
    Production
3d.its advatages are
It provides good documentation, it completes the process in itself.
It provides risk-management support.
It reuses the components, and hence total time duration is less
Disadvantages
Team of expert professional is required, as the process is complex.
Complex and not properly organized process.
More dependency on risk management
