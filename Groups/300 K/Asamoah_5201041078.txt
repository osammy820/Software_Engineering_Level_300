 1.   A software process model is an abstract representation of a process.It presents a description 
      of a process from some particular perspectiveIt is a very important part of the information 
      technology industry because it allows businesses to create custom applications that can 
      automate processes and improve efficiency


 2.  WATERFALL AND AGILE PROCESS MODEL

        --> Waterfall has a fixed timeline and Agile is a lot more flexible and accounts for experimenting with
            different directions.

       --> The Waterfall methodology budgeting is generally fixed beecause the project is determined from start
           to finish and Agile is open to adaptation, encourages experimentation and welcomes changes of direction,
           even in later phases of the project


     KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WATERFALL AND AGILE SOFTWARE PROCESS MODEL

           The key difference between Agile vs. Waterfall is that Waterfall breaks down software development
           into isolated phases that flow into each other, while Agile advocates iterative development cycles
           in which multiple lifecycle phases can run in parallel

    DRAWBACKS OF WATERFALL PROCESS MODEL

        --> Waterfall process model makes changes difficult
        --> It delays testing until after completion
        --> The Waterfall model can promote longer delivery times
  
    DRAWBACKS OF AGILE PROCESS MODEL

        --> Teams get easily sidetracked due to lack of processes
        --> Long-term projects suffer from incremental delivery
        --> The level of collaboration can be difficult to maintain

  
 3.  The Rational Unified Proces Methodology (RUP) is an agile software development method, in which the life
     cycle of a project, or the development of software, is divided into four phases. Various activities take
     place during these phases: modelling, analysis and design, implementation, testing and application.
  

    KEY PHASES AND ACTIVITIES INVOLVED IN RATIONAL UNIFIED PROCESS (RUP)

         INCEPTION –
         --> Communication and planning are the main ones.
         --> Identifies the scope of the project using a use-case model allowing managers to estimate costs and time required.
         --> Customers’ requirements are identified and then it becomes easy to make a plan for the project.
         --> The project plan, Project goal, risks, use-case model, and Project description, are made.


        ELABORATION 
        --> Planning and modeling are the main ones.
        --> A detailed evaluation and development plan is carried out and diminishes the risks.
        --> Revise or redefine the use-case model (approx. 80%), business case, and risks.
        --> Executable architecture baseline.


        CONSTRUCTION 
        --> The project is developed and completed.
        --> System or source code is created and then testing is done.
        --> Coding takes place.
 
        TRANSITION 
        --> The final project is released to the public.
        --> Transit the project from development into production.
        --> Update project documentation.
        --> Beta testing is conducted.
        --> Defects are removed from the project based on feedback from the public.

       PRODUCTION 
        The final phase of the model.
        The project is maintained and updated accordingly.


     BENEFITS OF RATIONAL UNIFIED PROCESS (RUP)

        --> It provides good documentation, it completes the process in itself.
        --> It provides risk-management support.
        --> It reuses the components, and hence total time duration is less.


     DRAWBACKS OF RATIONAL UNIFIED PROCESS (RUP)
 
       --> Team of expert professional is required, as the process is complex.
       --> Complex and not properly organized process.
       --> More dependency on risk management.
