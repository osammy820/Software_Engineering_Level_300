1.  A software process model is an abstract representation of the set of activities involved in producing a software.
It is important in the sense that it presents a description of a process from some particular perspective.


2.  The Waterfall model is a plan driven process, whereas the Agile process is flexible due to plan incremental nature.
All the process activities in a plan driven model are planned in advance and progress are measured against the plan.
   
In agile process, it is easy to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements.
It is easier to get customer feedback on the development work that has been done.
However, in the agile environment, system structure tend to degrade as new increaments are added.
Also, process is not visible under agile, and managers need regular deliverables to measure progress.
Documentations that comes with every version tends to raise cost.

The inflexible nature of the waterfall model makes it difficult to accommodate change after a phase is initiated.
This model helps coordinate the work in places where a system is developed at several sites.


3.  The Rational Unified Process is rather a modern generic process derived from the waterfall model, Incremental development
and the Reuse-Oriented model.

The RUL takes advantage of the three general process from the perspective of:
 a. Dynamic: showing phases over time;
 b. Static: showing process activities;
 c. Practive: suggesting good practice.

 The iterative phases consists of:
 * Inception: where the business case for the system is established;
 * Elaboration: where the understanding of the problem domain is developed;
  along with the system architecture;
 * Construction: where the system is designed, programmed and tested;
 * Transition: system is deployed in it's operating environment;
 * In-phase iteration: each phase is iterated with with results developed
 increamentally;
 * Cross-phase iteration: the whole set of phases may be enacted increamentally
