importance 
it helps to the processes as specifications, design ,validation and evolution to a software or product.

2.waterfall model 

advantagies
i.it is plan driven
ii.it has separate and distinct phases of specification and development.

disadvantages
i.a phase has to be complited before moving on.
ii.inflexible partitioning leads to difficulty in respond to changes.

agile

advantages
i.cost is reduce
ii.easy to get customer feed back

disadvantages
i.the processs is not visble
ii.system structures degrade due to changes.

3.the rational unified process is a generic proces that is made from UML and its associated process ,it brings together aspects of generic process model.making use of a combination of the plandriven and agile process.
whiles RUP makes use of the combination of the main process these two process stand alone in the operations.

phases of RUP
i.inception } helps to produce the business case for a system.

ii.elaboration } produces an understanding of the problem domain and the system structure.

iii.construction } it deals with system design ,programing and testing

iv.transition } deploys the system in the eperating enironment.

benefits 
i.it helpsto develop softwares iteratively.

drawbacks

i.cost and time consuming.
