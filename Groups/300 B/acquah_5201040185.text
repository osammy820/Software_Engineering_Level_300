Software process models are convenient tools that developers use to map every step of their projects.
It is important to help project managers plan their processes, estimate costs, identify challenges and communicate with teams 
and customers.

                              Advantages of Agile Model
1.It is  method that is centered on the customer. As a consequence, the customer is always involved throughout the entire 
process.
2.Agile teams are extremely active and self, and as a consequence, they are much more inclined to deliver superior results
in development projects.
3.The agile software development approach ensures that development quality is maintained throughout the development 
process.
4.The strategy is solely based on the notion of incremental consistent growth in progress. As a consequence, both the 
customer and the crew are informed of what has and has not been accomplished. As a consequence, 
the risk of the development phase is minimized.
                            Disadvantages of Agile Model
1.It is not a viable strategy for small-scale development efforts.
2.In order to try and make crucial choices during the meeting, it is vital to have a professional presentation.
3.The cost of implementing an agile approach is just somewhat greater when compared to traditional development approaches.
4.If the project manager isn’t clear on the end goal, the project might easily become derailed.
                            Advantages of Waterfall model
1.It is among the most simple types to operate. Because of the project’s nature, each phase contains deliverables and 
also a review process.
2.It is best suitable for smaller tasks with defined requirements that are simple to understand and execute.
completion of the job in a shorter amount of time
3.Both the procedure and the outcomes are meticulously recorded.
4.Simple to adopt a method for restructuring teams
5.This project management approach is useful for dealing with dependencies.
                          Disadvantages of Waterfall Model
1.This is not the preferred product for a big project.
2.This approach is less effective if the requirement is not clearly defined at the start.
3.It is difficult to travel ahead and make changes to previous stages.
4.The testing step starts after the design phase is finished. As a result, there is a high probability that flaws will be
found required during the development process when they will be more costly to repair.

The key difference between Agile vs. Waterfall is that Waterfall breaks down software development into isolated phases 
that flow into each other, while Agile advocates iterative development cycles in which multiple lifecycle phases can run 
in parallel.

                     Benefits of Waterfall Model.
1.Before the next phase of development, each phase must be completed.	
2.Suited for smaller projects where requirements are well defined.
                     Drawbacks of Waterfall Model.	
1.It is not desirable for complex project where requirement changes frequently
2.Error can be fixed only during the phase

                     Benefits of Agile Model
1.The entire team is involved in the planning.
2.Feedback is central to the process.
3.Customers and stakeholders are involved.
4.The customer journey is top of mind when a decision is made.
5.The team can adapt as new information is acquired.
6.Changes can be made along the way to avoid roadblocks or stalled work.
7.Each team member's capacity (workload) is continually assessed to prevent burnout.

                    Drawbacks of Agile Model
1.Agile techniques and terminology can be tough to grasp.
2.It can take teams a while to learn proper agile methods.
3.Agile teams may not get the support they require from management and business owners.
4.Not all team members may buy into the agile framework, presenting a disconnect across the team.
5.A lack of documentation can make the details unclear.

The Rational Unified Process (RUP) is an iterative software development process framework created by the Rational Software 
Corporation.
RUP is a framework for organizations and teams, while the Agile method is more intended for a product team with 
strict/clear guidelines. 
3b. RUP uses its predefined phases more specifically and these phases show what you do in the 
different phases.
3c. RUP is a framework for organizations and teams, while the Agile method is more intended for a product team with 
strict/clear guidelines.

                            Benefits of RUP.
1.It is an iterative approach that is better in some situations than a pure Waterfall approach
2.It also has some level of predictability if the level of uncertainty in the project is not too high
                           
                              Drawbacks of RUP.
1.It has a fair amount of overhead and isn’t quite as flexible and adaptive as Agile
2.The original implementation of RUP was heavily dependent on the Rational tool-set which is very expensive (Newer variations of RUP such as the Enterprise Unified Process have come out since then that are less dependent on the Rational tool-set)
3.It is no longer widely-used and has been largely superseded by Agile and Scrum which are much more flexible and adaptive and easier to use
