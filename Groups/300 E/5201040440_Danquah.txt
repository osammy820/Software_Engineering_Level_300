Q1.	A software process model is an abstract representation of a process used in the development of asoftware. 
The process model provides a structured approach to software development that helps ensure
quality, consistency, and efficiency in the development process and also provides a
framework for managing the development processes and that's why it is important in software development.

Q2.	The Waterfall model is a linear sequential process model, where each phase of the 
software development process is completed before the next phase begins while
the Agile model is an iterative and incremental process model, where software is 
developed in short, iterative cycles that involve continuous feedback and 
collaboration between the developers and stakeholders.

--KEY DIFFERENCE--
Waterfall is plan driven while Agile is value and product driven.

--BENEFITS--
Waterfall is suited for projects with well-defined requirements and a fixed
timeframe while Agile is suited for projects with changing requirements and no
fixed timeframe.


Q3.	Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a software development process model that provides a
framework for developing software in a disciplined and controlled manner.
	RUP differs from other software development process models which is an iterative, incremental,
and use-case driven process that focuses on architecture, design, and testing.


--PHASES--
I.Inception
	Activity:Defining the scope, reasons for the project and risks of the project.
II.Elaboration
	Activity:Developing the system strecture and refine the project plan if need be.
III.Construction 
	Activity:Building the system and performing tests.
IV.Transition
	Activity:Deploying the system and maintaing the system.
	

--BENEFITS--
I.There's is a structure to manage risks invovled in projects.
II.Provides a controlled approach to software development which increases efficiency

--DEAWBACKS--
I.It can be complex and time-consuming when working on smaller or less complex projects
II.It requires a skilled and experienced development team to carry out the phases involved
