ANSWERS TO THE ABOVE QUESTIONS
QUESTION 1
Software process model is a structured set of activities required to develop a software system.

Importance:
1.Provide a clear understanding of how the software processes work.
2.Create consistency and a way to standardise and control processes.
3.Set clear expectations and helps to reduce redundancies.

QUESTION 2 

Waterfall model:
The waterfall model, is a sequential, plan driven-process where you must plan and schedule all your activities 
before starting the project.Each activity in the waterfall model is represented as a separate phase arranged in
linear order.The phases include: Requirement gathering , System and software Design, Implementation and
unit testing, System Testing Operational and maintenance

Agile Model:
The Agile model, is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that focuses on delivering working 
software quickly and continuously throughout the project. In the agile process model Requirements 
are assumed to change, System evolves over a series of iterations, Customers are involved during each iteration,
Documentation is done only when needed.

Key differences:
The Agile process model is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. Whiles 
Waterfall model, is a sequential, plan driven-process to software development.

Benefits of Waterfall model:
1. The requirements are determined in the early stage.
2. It is easy to manage. 
3. Helps identify and manage risks early on in the project.

Drawbacks of Waterfall model:
1. It  highly structured and regimented, so it make changes difficult.
2. It Can lead to longer development and delays.
3. It exclude the client.

Benefits of Agile model:
1. It is flexibile.
2. It allows control over the project due to its transparency and feedback integration. 
3.It encourages collaboration and communication 

Drawbacks of Agile model:
1.It Can result in lack of documentation and planning.
2.It can be more difficult to accurately estimate the time to finish the project.
3.It increase greater demands from clients and developers.

QUESTION 3
Rational Unified Process (RUP) is an iterative software development process framework for 
developing a high quality software. It describe three perspective that is a dynamic perspective
that shows phases over time, a static perspective that shows the process activities and a perspective
that shows good practices.

The key phases of RUP include;
1.Inception: The team establishes a business case for the system.
2.Elaboration: The team identifies risk, develops a project plan and creates system architecture.
3.Construction: The team develops parallel components.
4.Transition: The team delivers the system into its operating environment for customer review.

Benefits of RUP:
1.It is well Documented and complete methodology.
2.It is proactive to clients changing requirements and related risk. 
3.It reduces integration time and effort .

Drowbacks of RUP:
1.The process is too complex.
2.May lead to totally indisciplined form of software development.
3.Difficult to implement in smaller projects.
